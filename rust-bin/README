# rust-bin README

This port is provided as a convenience for users who are interested in
compiling rust code, but are otherwise discouraged by the prospect of 
rebuilding a toolchain every six weeks. As a **consumer** of rust code 
you will enjoy mostly the same experience using this port as you would 
with opt/rust. All you need to do is put the line 
  rust-bin: rust
into your prt-get aliases file, to ensure that dependency resolution 
does not trigger building rust from source.

Caution: if you want to **author** a rust project, and you rely on hints
from an IDE, the absence of binaries in the expected location /usr/libexec
might cause problems. Feel free to create a symlink for:
  /usr/lib/rust-analyzer-proc-macro-srv,
because chrpath cannot accomplish the libexec-dir-change that the patches
for opt/rust would do.

Starting with rust 1.85.1, this port is flexible enough to accommodate
two different libc implementations: glibc and musl. There might be some
ports that fail to compile with the less-tested musl variant of rust-bin.
If you anticipate needing to compile such ports, you should install rust
from source instead.
